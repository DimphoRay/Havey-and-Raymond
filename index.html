            <p>
                Dear Havey,<br><br>
                From the moment our paths crossed, my heart has been filled with an overwhelming joy that I never thought was possible. Your laughter, your kindness, and your love have become the most precious parts of my life. Every day with you is a beautiful adventure that I cherish deeply. Your smile lights up my world and your presence makes everything better. I am so grateful to have you by my side and to share this incredible journey with you. I promise to always be here for you, to love you with all my heart, and to make every moment together as special as you are to me.<br><br>
                With all my love,<br>
                Raymond
